For this assignment I decided to create a concept for the title screen of a future game in the Steins;Gate series. I made a rough approximation of the time machine from the original game in Blender and put three separate light objects on it. The lights glow just like my cat did in hw2 (using a shader with an emissiveness parameter and a bloom filter on the camera), except instead of fading on and off they react to certain the volume of certain frequencies coming from my audio source, which plays "Gate of Steiner" by Takeshi Abo. I'm fairly certain this song is available under a CC-like license since it's still on YouTube even though the rest of the game OST (from the same uploader and in the same playlist) was recently taken down. The ground is deformed using the same image I used for hw2, except it's a little less pretty since this ground is bigger and a rectangle instead of a square. I also put the text and its background in the scene instead of as UI elements since it was just a little easier. I fiddled with particle systems for a bit until I got a pretty decent-looking snowstorm; the snowflakes react to a small amount of noise.

As a side note, the console pops up with lots of warnings when my program runs. I assume there's some issue with 2019.1.4f1 since most of them are marked as "Internal".
